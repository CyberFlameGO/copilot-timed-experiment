# GitHub Copilot: Timed Experiment

Hello! If you're reading this, then the clock has already started. Let's go!

1. First, `npm i` to install all the needed dependencies
2. The task's instructions are inside `index.js`
3. The clock stops when you commit **and push** an implementation that passes the test suite. No points are awarded for solutions that are not pushed to GitHub!
## Frequently asked questions

> How do I run the test suite locally to check my work?

`npm test` will run the test suite.

> Am I allowed to consult the internet?

Do whatever you would normally do to write code!

> How often should I push my work to GitHub?
> Should I wait until everything works?

Push as often as you like!  We measure from the time you accept the assignment until the moment that GitHub Classroom records a successful run of the entire test suite. We ignore failed/partially failed test runs.

> How much time has elapsed? How much time is left?
> Can I see the timer?

There's no way to see the timer. When we can see a passing test suite, we stop the clock.

Good luck! Make all the tests pass!
